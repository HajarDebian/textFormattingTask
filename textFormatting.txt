Text Formatting is the way or elements we use to define the text's shape, and to give it a special meaning.
HTML has some elements that format the text as well, like:
-<b> & <strong> --> for bold text
-<i> & <em> --> for italic or emphasized text
-<mark> --> for highlighted text
-<small> --> for a text with smaller font size
-<del> --> for delelted text (has line on it)
-<ins> --> for inserted text (underlined)
-<sub> --> for subscript text (lowered down)
-<sup> --> for superscript text (up above more than the rest of the text)
